  rules:
    - "States must be sequential: 0..nstates-1"
    - "Each state has exactly one condition"
    - "target_offset must be 0 or 1 (points to another state in a 3-state FSM)"
    - "No module parameters appear in the config string (defaults are used)"
  notes:
    - "Uses module descriptions from the module_package in config_foraging.yaml"
    - "If a module expects parameters, the default values are applied at runtime"
